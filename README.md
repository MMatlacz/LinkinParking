EOS San Francisco hackathon project.

Shared economy for renting parking spaces

We give users the opportunity to earn money off of their unused parking spaces.
Linkin Parking is a real-world application that allows making money with parking spot when you aren't there and offers a more cost-effective parking solution to people in metropolitan areas that want access to a parking space.
